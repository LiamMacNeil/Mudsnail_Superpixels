This is an accompanying respository (R script and raw data files) for our [paper] describing an application for image segmentation, based on clustering superpixels, to enumerate and size (length) mudsnails from common stereomicroscopy images. This method expedited counting and measuring tremendously and yielded data-rich, reproducible data products to assess the growth response of a common mudsnail under experimental warming treatments.
